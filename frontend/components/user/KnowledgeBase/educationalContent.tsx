  'Laws of the Ocean': `Maritime laws are a complex set of regulations that govern activities on the ocean. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the primary international agreement that establishes guidelines for businesses, the environment, and management of marine resources.
  
Key elements include:
• Territorial Sea: Extends up to 12 nautical miles from a country's coastline
• Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): Extends 200 nautical miles from shore
• High Seas: Areas beyond national jurisdiction
• Marine Protected Areas: Designated conservation zones
• International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations

These laws help prevent overfishing, regulate shipping, manage resource extraction, and protect marine ecosystems.`,

  'Types of Incidents': `Maritime incidents can have severe consequences for human life, economic activity, and the environment. Common types include:

• Ship Collisions: When vessels strike each other due to navigation errors, poor visibility, or equipment failures
• Oil Spills: Release of petroleum into the ocean, often from tanker accidents or offshore drilling
• Groundings: When vessels run aground on reefs, sandbars, or other underwater features
• Fires and Explosions: Can occur due to fuel handling errors or cargo problems
• Illegal Fishing: Unauthorized extraction of marine resources
• Piracy: Robbery or criminal violence at sea
• Marine Debris Incidents: Pollution from garbage, lost cargo, and abandoned fishing gear

Quick reporting of incidents can help minimize damage and enable effective responses.`,

  'Overfishing': `Overfishing occurs when fish are caught faster than they can reproduce, leading to population collapse. This practice has depleted over 30% of the world's fisheries.

Consequences include:
• Ecosystem imbalance as predator-prey relationships are disrupted
• Bycatch of non-target species including endangered sea turtles, sharks, and marine mammals
• Economic losses for fishing communities as resources disappear
• Food security threats for coastal populations that depend on seafood

Sustainable fishing practices include:
• Catch limits and quotas
• Seasonal restrictions
• Marine protected areas
• Improved fishing gear to reduce bycatch
• Fishery certification programs

Individual actions like choosing sustainable seafood can help combat overfishing.`,

  'Dynamite Fishing': `Dynamite or blast fishing is a destructive fishing practice where explosives are detonated underwater to stun or kill fish for easy collection.

Devastating effects include:
• Immediate destruction of coral reef structures that took centuries to form
• Indiscriminate killing of all marine life in the blast radius
• Long-lasting habitat destruction that prevents ecosystem recovery
• Loss of coral reef ecosystem services valued at up to $1 million per km²
• Reduction in fish populations beyond the immediate area

This practice is illegal in most countries but continues in some regions due to poverty, lack of enforcement, and the immediate economic gain for fishers. Community education, alternative livelihoods, and stronger law enforcement are key strategies to combat this destructive practice.`,

  'Unique Marine Life': `The ocean houses some of Earth's most extraordinary creatures, many with remarkable adaptations:

• Bioluminescent organisms like the anglerfish use light-producing chemicals for hunting, defense, or finding mates
• The mimic octopus can impersonate at least 15 different species by changing color, texture, and behavior
• Mantis shrimp have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and can deliver punches at 50 mph
• The immortal jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii) can revert to an earlier life stage when injured or stressed
• Extremophiles near hydrothermal vents thrive in super-heated water with toxic chemicals

Marine biodiversity is essential for ecosystem stability, medical research, and understanding evolutionary adaptations. Yet many unique species remain undiscovered, highlighting the importance of ocean conservation.`,

  'Coral Reefs': `Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, supporting approximately 25% of all marine species while covering less than 1% of the ocean floor.

These living structures:
• Provide habitats and nurseries for thousands of marine species
• Protect coastlines from storms and erosion
• Support fishing and tourism industries worth billions annually
• Contain compounds used in medicines for cancer, arthritis, and bacterial infections

Major threats include:
• Climate change causing coral bleaching
• Ocean acidification weakening coral skeletons
• Pollution from agricultural runoff and sewage
• Destructive fishing practices
• Coastal development

Conservation efforts focus on creating marine protected areas, reducing carbon emissions, improving water quality, and coral restoration projects. Artificial reefs and coral gardening show promising results for rehabilitating damaged reef systems.`
